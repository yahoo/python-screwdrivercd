Add support for changelogs, this adds a new command `screwdrivercd_changelog` that will generate
a changelog based on changelog fragments in the changelog directory.  The command uses the git
history to determine the release the changelog fragment was added in.  This changelog is written
to the $SD_ARTIFACTS_DIR/report/changelog directory.

```console
$ screwdrivercd_changelog
$
```
